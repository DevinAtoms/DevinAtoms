- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DevinAtoms
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in whatever strikes my fancy. Generally cross platform apps, data processing, and Web APIs. Also maybe some game development at some point.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, exploring C# and Dart, considering some C.

Also, I recently changed my GitHub name so I don't think a lot of my commit history is showing up on these repos. I swear I've been more active than it looks!
