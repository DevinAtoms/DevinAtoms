## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Devin Adams, aka @DevinAtoms

- I'm currently looking to build some generalized programming and project skills. I've got a few repositories for generalized personal projects, mostly Python based at the moment.
- This is probably uncontroversial, but PyCharm Professional is currently my Python IDE of choice. I like Atom for HTML and CSS, VSCode for everything else.

- You can reach me at Adams.Devin.C@gmail.com or linkedin.com/in/devin-c-adams/. I'm always interested in Product/Project Management opportunities, so please feel free to contact me!

Also, I recently changed my GitHub name so I don't think a lot of my commit history is showing up on these repos. I swear I've been more active than it looks!
