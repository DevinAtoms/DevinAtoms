# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Devin Adams, aka @DevinAtoms
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in whatever strikes my fancy. Generally cross platform apps, data processing, and Web APIs. Also maybe some game development at some point.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, exploring C# and Dart, considering some C.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at Adams.Devin.C@gmail.com or linkedin.com/in/devin-c-adams/

- PyCharm Professional is currently my Python IDE of choice. I like Atom for HTML and CSS, VSCode for everything else.


Also, I recently changed my GitHub name so I don't think a lot of my commit history is showing up on these repos. I swear I've been more active than it looks!
