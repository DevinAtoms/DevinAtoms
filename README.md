# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Devin Adams, aka @DevinAtoms

### I'm a hobbyist programmer, hoping to learn enough to shift careers into the Software industry.

- I've got a decent grasp on a Python and Go, but I'd like to learn more. Python was my first language and I really enjoy the data processing capabilities. Go is just a cool language and I think there's some cool stuff happening in that space.

  - My teenage years were in the Myspace era, so I developed some HTML and CSS skills pretty early on. They're not the most robust, but I'm comfortable working with it and learning.
  - I did some experimenting with Dart and Flutter, but I didn't get super far with that as I didn't like being bound as much to the Material Design system.
  - I've started to get somewhat of a grasp on really basic C, that's the one I'm really trying to get more well-versed in.
  - Additional languages I'd like to experiment more with are C#, Javascript/Typescript, and I really want to get an opportunity to work with SQL.

- If you're seeing this, there's a high likelihood that you got linked here from my Linkedin or Resume/Job Application. If so, please check out some of my projects and feel free to reach out!
