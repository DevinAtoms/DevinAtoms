## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Devin Adams, aka @DevinAtoms

- I'm a hobbyist programmer who's just working to build some skills and maybe turn this into a real job one day.

- Python was my first language and the one I've worked with the most, although I've recently fallen in love with Go.

- You can reach me at Adams.Devin.C@gmail.com or linkedin.com/in/devin-c-adams/. I'm always interested in Product/Project Management opportunities, so please feel free to contact me!
